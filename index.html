            <p>My name is Andrew Leetham. I live in Camas, Washington. I like to play video, board, trading card, and role-playing games. 
                I'm an introvert, and a relatively private person, so I'll leave things at that for now.

            <p>Washington is the northwesternmost state in the lower 48. It is divided by the Cascade Mountains into the dryer east and the temperate rainforest west. Honestly, all I know about eastern Washington is that you have to get past it to go to Idaho. Much of the southern border (with Oregon) is the Columbia River, which created a gorge with lots of cool hiking opportunities and waterfalls where it cuts through the Cascades.</p>
